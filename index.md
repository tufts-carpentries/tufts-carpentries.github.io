**Carpentries at Tufts** is a group of data and technology professionals from across Tufts University who have come together to provide open <a href="https://carpentries.org/">**Carpentries**</a> workshops. We offer two-day workshop using the curricula from both Data and Software Carpentry. They cover topics like Shell scripting, git, Python, R, spreadsheets, and OpenRefine.  

We are continuously updating the lessons we offer, so if there is a particular lesson you are interested in please let us know and we will see what we can do. 

If you want more information or would like to request a workshop, please email the Research Data Management team at <a href = "mailto: rdm@tufts.edu">rdm@tufts.edu</a>.
